# Author
Welcome to my ReadMe. My name is Tushar Asthana and I am the sole contributor. 

# Summary
The summary of this program is that I am using Crow cpp as my backend to serve as a localhost for my website that I built. 
The backend is build in C++ using app routes and image manipulation. My website is made out of 
html5, css and javascript, and is fully functioning. 

# Background
This project is more an experiment in what I can hold on to in my career as a web developer. 
It took me three days to figure out Crow. I took inspiration from a image manipulation project, and have added it 
as tab to be used on the website. I also have the code for my animation, but unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to use Emscripten to actually have it render. The animation was meant to render when the user was clicking through the differnt pages of the website. 

# Add-Ons
You will need to download Crow, Boost, and OpenCV2 from their websites. I am using a MacBook Pro, running Apple M2, and using vscode for all code. 

I have a fully stood up html website, created on a C++ app that I learned how to use. I have an animation that I coded that I cannot implement on this app, and I have an image manipulation tab as well. 

The majority of the code used was within html and C++.
