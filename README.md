Welcome to my ReadMe. My name is Tushar Asthana and I am the sole contributor. 

The summary of this program is that I am using Crow cpp as my backend to serve as a localhost for my website that I built. 
The backend is build in C++ using app routes and image manipulation to incoporate some of the modules. My website is made out of 
html5, css and javascript, and is fully functioning. 

Back to the modules used, this project is more an experiment in what I can hold on to in my career as a web developer. 
It took me three days to figure out Crow. I took inspiration from the image manipulation project in module three, and have added it 
as tab to be used on the website. I also have the code for my animation which I had discussed with Lisa, but unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to use Emscripten to actually have it render. The code is mostly from one of the guided projects in Module 4. 

You will need to download Crow, Boost, and OpenCV2 from their websites respectively. I have included the links above. I am using a MacBook Pro, running Apple M2, and using vscode for all code. 

I believe I should get around 150 points for this project. Professor Lisa and I never got a chance to really discuss the rubric i had decided on. I had to flip courses about a week ago, since I need middleware to actually run an animation on the server side in html, and it is really difficult. I have a fully stood up html website, created on a C++ app that I learned how to use about four days ago. I have an animation that I coded that I cannot implement on this app, and I have an image manipulation tab as well. 

I have major code in c++ and have tried new things with c++, so I belive I have earned those points.
