            Welcome to my ReadMe. My name is Tushar Asthana and I am the sole contributor.

            The summary of this program is that I am using Crow cpp as my backend to serve as a localhost for my website that I built. 
            The backend is build in C++ using app routes and image manipulation to incoporate some of the modules. My website is made out of 
            html5, css and javascript, and is fully functioning. 

            Back to the modules used, this project is more an experiment in what I can hold on to in my career as a web developer. 
            It took me three days to figure out Crow. I took inspiration from the image manipulation project in module three, and have added it 
            as tab to be used on the website. 

            You will need to download Crow, Boost, and OpenCV2 from their websites respectively.
